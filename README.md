# WordscapesSolver.github.io
This was a fun little project where I learned how to use javascript inside of html and the host it in github pages.
It works by creating a map of the letters you have where the key is the letter and a value for the amount. For example the word test would have 't' = 2, 'e' = 1, 's' = 1.
Then during the main loop it goes through every word in a file with a bunch of english words and makes a map for each of those.
After both maps are made it compares the two to see if it is possible to make the word and if it is it adds it to a string that gets put into a paragraph element in html.
Overall it was a fun project to refresh myself on html and learn javascript.
